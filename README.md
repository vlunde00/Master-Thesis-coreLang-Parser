# Master-Thesis-coreLang-Parser

A coreLang parser was made during the writing of a master thesis about automated threat modelling in a medical system.

The parser works for a .json file system specifications file of the Getinge Servo TwinView that can not be provided here due to it being proprietary to Getinge. This parser
can serve as an inspiration to similar parsers for other .json file system specifications. 

In order to use the parser, you need to download and compile coreLang into a .mar file and you also need to download and use the MAL toolbox together with the Python file.
The parser can then be executed with the command: python3 coreLang_twinview.py

The resulting coreLang .mar and the .json system specificaitons file needs to be provided in the code.

Some example graphical output is also provided in this repository.
